# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KaviosPix is an API-based image management system similar to Google Photos that allows users to authenticate via Google OAuth, create and manage albums, upload and organize images with metadata, and share albums with other users. The system provides comprehensive image management capabilities including tagging, commenting, favoriting, and person identification while maintaining secure access control through JWT tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my Google account, so that I can securely access the image management system without creating separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL redirect them to Google OAuth2 authentication
2. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's email and generate a unique userId
3. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT token for subsequent API requests
4. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token before processing the request
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and deny access

### Requirement 2: Album Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage albums, so that I can organize my images into meaningful collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an album THEN the system SHALL require a name and allow an optional description
2. WHEN an album is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique albumId and set the creator as the owner
3. WHEN a user updates an album THEN the system SHALL only allow the owner to modify the description
4. WHEN a user deletes an album THEN the system SHALL only allow the owner to delete it and remove all associated images
5. WHEN an album is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify the user has permission (owner or shared access)

### Requirement 3: Album Sharing

**User Story:** As an album owner, I want to share my albums with other users via email, so that they can view my images without needing to own them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an owner shares an album THEN the system SHALL accept a list of valid email addresses
2. WHEN users are added to an album THEN the system SHALL verify the emails exist in the system
3. WHEN an album is shared THEN the shared users SHALL have read-only access to the album and its images
4. WHEN shared users access the album THEN the system SHALL allow viewing but prevent deletion of images or the album
5. IF invalid emails are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors

### Requirement 4: Image Upload and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload images to my albums with metadata, so that I can store and organize my photos with relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL only accept image file types (jpg, png, gif)
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL enforce a maximum file size limit of 5MB
3. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract and store file metadata (name, size, uploadedAt timestamp)
4. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL allow optional metadata (tags, person name, favorite status)
5. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL assign a unique imageId
6. IF invalid file type or size is uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Image Metadata Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add and manage metadata for my images, so that I can organize, search, and interact with my photos effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds tags to an image THEN the system SHALL store them as a searchable list
2. WHEN a user identifies a person in an image THEN the system SHALL store the person's name
3. WHEN a user marks an image as favorite THEN the system SHALL update the isFavorite boolean field
4. WHEN a user adds comments to an image THEN the system SHALL store them as an array of strings
5. WHEN metadata is updated THEN the system SHALL only allow users with access to the album to make changes

### Requirement 6: Image Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter images by various criteria, so that I can quickly find specific photos in my collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches by tags THEN the system SHALL return all images containing the specified tags
2. WHEN a user requests favorite images THEN the system SHALL return only images marked as favorites
3. WHEN a user views an album THEN the system SHALL return all images with their complete metadata
4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include imageId, name, tags, person, isFavorite, comments, size, and uploadedAt
5. IF no images match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set

### Requirement 7: Data Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want my images and albums to be secure and only accessible to authorized users, so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token
2. WHEN a user accesses an album THEN the system SHALL verify they are either the owner or have shared access
3. WHEN a user attempts to modify an album THEN the system SHALL only allow the owner to make changes
4. WHEN a user attempts to delete images THEN the system SHALL verify they have appropriate permissions
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401 or 403 error codes with appropriate messages

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can understand and correct any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
2. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear reasons (file type, size, etc.)
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate authentication error messages
4. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 errors with descriptive messages
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 500 errors without exposing sensitive information
